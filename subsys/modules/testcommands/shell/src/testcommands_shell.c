/**
 * Implement bare minimum commands to run the internal Pytest test harness for automated tests.
 * 
 * NOTE: This does not yet implement everything correctly in order to run all tests in 'tests' folder
 *       currently run with baremetal testapp. Just the bare minimum for the harness initialization
 *       to go through and allow execution of selected tests. See TODOs below.
 *
 * TODO:
 *       - Reserve test memory areas from all retention lines and return correct pointers to them
 *         (might mean custom linker file).
 *       - Correctly deduce the used clock and dividers to determine and return current clock frequency.
 *       - Some tests potentially rely on predetermined 'BOARD' definition strings that differ from the
 *         ones used within Zephyr. Might beed mapping either here or in the Pytest harness.
